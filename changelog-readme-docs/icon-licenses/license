[20:29:07] <cleary> e bluewater
[20:30:03] <bluewater> cleary: i need a copy of the art license,, whats the besy link?
[20:30:09] <bluewater> best
[20:30:14] <cleary> what art license?
[20:30:53] <bluewater> the sidux book cathbard dd that I use in manuals
[20:30:59] <bluewater> dd = did
[20:31:18] <cleary> no idea
[20:31:27] <cleary> you'll need to ask cathbard I think
[20:31:34] <bluewater> hmm have to go find it then

[20:32:03] <cleary> you can trawl the commit mailing list for fullstory
[20:33:02] <bluewater> well it was inplace til the new logo for manuals  on the desktop  ( the blue one), so has to be somewhere

[20:34:33] <cleary> I've only got commits in my gmail back to march 29

[20:35:03] <bluewater> heh  yes otherwise 10 gig of emails,, grins

[20:35:55] <etorix> shouldnt it be in the deb
[20:36:14] <cleary> etorix: the deb provides the new icon
[20:36:17] <cleary> not cathbard's
[20:36:32] <cleary> the license only covers current distribution
[20:36:46] <etorix> hmm .. old iso then
[20:36:58] <bluewater> etorix: double checking it, before i fire off an email, as far as I am concerned it was on chaos, so its good to go
[20:37:00] <cleary> etorix: that would do

[20:37:30] <cleary> bluewater: it is distributable, but you must supply the license when you distribute it
[20:37:48] <cleary> etorix: you got any old isos?
[20:37:53] <bluewater> cleary: yes,, thats what I am after
[20:38:10] <bluewater> i think I have a chaos here,, let me go rummage
[20:38:23] <etorix> u could ask cathbard, might need a ned kelly shirt tho

[20:38:58] <cleary> bluewater: check /usr/share/doc/<package>/copyright
[20:39:03] <cleary> when you boot chaos
[20:39:14] <cleary> where package is whatever the manual was called back then

[21:01:11] <bluewater> they were the designers of the original book
[21:05:06] <etorix> hm
[21:05:40] <etorix> cathbard basically stole the best of spacepenguin's idea, really
[21:06:30] <etorix> that whole episode put me off him
[21:08:09] <bluewater> as far as I know this is the original, gawd knows how or why i kept it, talk about a squirrel
[21:08:19] <etorix> terminally
[21:09:21] <etorix> he seemed to be throwing his weight about and elbowing ppl out of the way

[21:10:49] <cleary> that looks right to me
[21:11:03] <cleary> that should've been in the original copyright
[21:12:16] <bluewater> i will place the combination in the file for recoll,, that will allow him total freedom

[21:22:03] <bluewater> hhmm sidux foundation inc,, 
[21:22:34] <bluewater> that is what it was back then

[22:09:04] <cleary> bluewater: just check what the stanza is referring to
[22:09:06] <cleary> eg

[22:09:19] <cleary> The Debian packaging is (C) 2007, Kel Modderman <kel@otaku42.de>
[22:09:19] <cleary> and is licensed under the GPL, see `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL'.
[22:09:26] <cleary> that's irrelevant
[22:10:03] <cleary> the sidux foundation bit is irrelevant too, because the icons are specifically (C) cathbard
[22:10:30] <cleary> imo you can safely nuke:
